<p>Nostros is a nostr client for Android and nostr is a protocol that allows you to create a censorship-resistant social network.</p><p>In Nostros you can create your keys to access nostr and start interacting with other people. Below we explain what you can do in nostr using Nostros.</p><b>Functionalities:</b><ul> <li>Post notes with text and images. You can indicate whether your note contains sensitive content so that other people who don't want to see it can filter that content. </li> <li>Reward other people with tips through the Lightning Network.</li> <li>Read other people's notes and react to them indicating: I like it or I don't like it.</li> <li>Share or quote other people's notes, just share or share them by adding your quote.</li> <li>Threads of conversation in the notes.</li> <li>Create and join public groups. Mute users.</li> <li>Visualizes in which relays a note has been seen by means of a color code.</li> <li>Activate or deactivate relays for your global feed.</li> <li>Block other people.</li> <li>Write private and encrypted messages to another person from nostr.</li> <li>View the feed of the people you follow or view the global feed, where you will see all the notes published in the relays to which you are connected. </li> <li>Do not miss anything by accessing the notifications section, where you can see all the interactions that other people have had with you. </li> <li>Add and follow other people on us or unfollow them.</li> <li>See all the people you follow and also those who follow you.</li> <li>Visualize by colors in which relays each note is.</li> <li>Verify yourself with NIP05.</li> <li>Add your Lightning Address to your profile so other people can send you Bitcoin tips through the Lightning Network. </li> <li>Set your preferred satoshi symbol.</li> <li>Global app settings: show or hide images in the global feed, show or hide notes with sensitive content.</li> <li>Manage the connections to the relays: add, delete, activate, deactivate and view the information of the relay. </li></ul><p></p><p>Nostros has his own database which reduces data consumption considerably and is relay friendly.</p><p> Nostros is an open source project in full development, so we encourage you to contribute to the project.</p><p> Before accessing nostr remember that in order to do so you have to generate a pair of keys: the private key and the public key. Summarizing it a lot, a public key is a password to access nostr in "read-only" mode, it will also help you share it with other people so they can follow you. The private key is like your password, by accessing us with it you will be able to publish and interact with other people's content.</p><p>You can create your key pair when accessing the Nostros app, but remember to keep your private key in a safe place, it is the only way to recover your account and it will be impossible to do so if you lose it.</p><p>If you want to know more about nostr you can visit the official repository on GitHub, where you will find all the information you need:</p><a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr" target="_blank">https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr</a><p>If you feel like contributing your skills to the project you can do so through the GitHub repository:</p><a href="https://github.com/KoalaSat/nostros" target="_blank">https://github.com/KoalaSat/nostros</a><p>Find the official Nostros account on nostr by adding this public key:</p><p> npub19l0cks7zmf6sz062peqlq277zmuskhgad58lgnr2awpp3t95esfstaws8n</p>
